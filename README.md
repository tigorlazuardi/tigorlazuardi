# Hi, I'm Tigor

I am a web backend developer that uses REST or GRPC, or PubSub application to communicate between services. My main language is Golang, with secondary ones being TypeScript and Rust.

# 💼 Ongoing Projects

1. Trying to make golang database transaction abstraction layer between SQL and NoSQL, so the codebase can swap database willy-nilly without changing any of the logic business.
2. Personal @Home website
3. The rest are private office projects.

# 📖 Learning

1. Rust. The memory management side mostly. I want to understand how pc handles memory when asking from kernel or the baremetal.
2. Godot game developement engine. Let's just say I want to create a game someday.
3. Tailwind CSS. I think I just found the perfect web visual framework for me.

# 🏝️ Projects Looking Forward to Work On

1. Smart Home project.
2. OpenAPI style business.
3. Modding a game.
4. A Neovim plugin

# 🗝️ Word of Wisdom

Logging is important! It's the only proof that a transaction does happen in production!
