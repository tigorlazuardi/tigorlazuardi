# Hi, I'm Tigor

I am a web backend developer that uses REST or GRPC, or PubSub application to communicate between services. My main language is Golang, with secondary ones being TypeScript and Rust.

# 💼 Ongoing Projects

1. GRPC Generating pipeline. The pipeline is special because it require validation testing both on the proto itself and the generated code to ensure the generated code can be use as expected (like no duplicate methods for example). The generated code will then pushed to another repository and it can be used as dependency for other projects.
2. Trying to make golang database transaction abstraction layer between SQL and NoSQL, so the codebase can swap database willy-nilly without changing any of the logic business.
3. Personal @Home website
4. The rest are private office projects.

# 📖 Learning

1. Rust. The memory management side mostly. I want to understand how pc handles memory when asking from kernel or the baremetal.
2. Godot game developement engine. Let's just say I want to create a game someday.
3. Tailwind CSS. I think I just found the perfect web visual framework for me.

# 🏝️ Projects Looking Forward to Work On

1. Smart Home project.
2. OpenAPI style business.
3. Modding a game.
4. A Neovim plugin

# 🗝️ Word of Wisdom

Logging is important! It's the only proof that a transaction does happen in production!
